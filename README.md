### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We built a website that allows you to either generate a random motivational poster or create one yourself by choosing an image and a quote and a title, save the poster (whether its randomly generated or custom made) to a designated page without saving duplicates, double click on a saved poster to delete it and use buttons to navigate throughout the page. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They have to go to our repository on github get the SSH key, do git clone SSH key on their local terminal and then open the test editor by cding into the cloned directory and running code . then to open the website you run the command open index.html
### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We began actually coding on Wednesday, we spent about 3.5 hours completing iteration 1. Thursday we spent about 4 hours working on iteration two. Friday we spent about 7.5 hours finishing iteration 2 and working on iteration 3. Saturday we spent about 7 hours finishing iteration 3 and starting iteration 4 and Sunday we spent about two hours finishing iteration 4.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
The learing goals were to build a functional website using html and javascript by using the DOM. We worked with javascript, HTML, CSS, the DOM and many functions within them. We also worked with event listeners a lot to make our website dynamic and usable for users. 
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
The biggest wins were figuring out how to get the entire posters deleted by double clicking anywhere on the poster, we were struggling for a long time because it would only delete the poster if you clicked on the blacknabground, otherwise it would only delete the title, or quote or image depending on what you clicked. We did a lot of google searching and discussing with classmates to figure that out. Another major win was getting the photos to save to the grid, at first we were using innerHTML which would just replace each poster. We did a lot of google searching and speaking with classmates to figure out an alternative way to insert html (insertAdjacentHTML).
